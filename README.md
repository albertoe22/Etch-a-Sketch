Starting an "etch a sketch" project where each grid space can be changed into a different color.

Fun side project, most difficult part by far is the where I had to try to make the grid size stay the same,
while there are more or less squares. Meaning the sizes of the squares had to scale with how many there are, relative
to the grid size. Really nice to see it in this state. 

9/20 edit
-Fixed part where the color wheel would not update the initial color when changing on the color picker.
